# Tuples = These are immutable datatypes in python
# Tuples are defined using parentheses ()
# Tuples can store multiple items in a single variable
# Tuples can store different data types
# Tuples are ordered, meaning the items have a defined order, and that order will not change
# Tuples allow duplicate values
# Tuples are indexed, meaning you can access items by referring to their index number (starting at index 0)
# Tuples are faster than lists
# Tuples have less built-in methods than lists
# We can write 1 number in bracket as a = (1,), This will tell python that this is a tuple  

# e = () #This is an empty tuple
a = (12,4,6,8, "Sanghaar", False, 333.333) #This is a tuple with integers
print(type(a)) # This will print the type of variable 'a', which is a tuple
print(a)
